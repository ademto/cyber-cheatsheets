| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `htop`  | Launches the `htop` interactive interface to show running processes, CPU, memory, and swap usage. |

### Common Options with `htop` {.col-start-1 .row-start-2}

| Option              | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-d <delay>`        | Sets the delay between screen updates (e.g., `-d 10` means 10 seconds delay). |
| `-u <user>`         | Displays only processes owned by the specified user.                          |
| `-p <pid>`          | Shows only processes with specific PIDs.                                      |
